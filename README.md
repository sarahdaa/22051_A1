# Individual Assignment 1 - Signal Analysis

## Description
This project is part of the *Signals and Linear Systems in Discrete Time* course at DTU. The goal of the assignment is to analyze and reproduce a 1000 Hz signal based on given specifications. The project includes:
- Analysis of the provided signal's properties (e.g., frequency spectrum).
- Creation of plots to visualize the signal.
- Reproduction of the 1000 Hz signal and discussion of its key characteristics.

## Files Included
- `IA1.m`: MATLAB script for signal analysis and reproduction.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and its purpose.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `IA1.m` in MATLAB and run the script to see the results.
